            Locating exposed RabbitMQ Management Consoles
            Description: Using the dork `intitle:"RabbitMQ Management"` can locate publicly accessible RabbitMQ Management Consoles. RabbitMQ is a message broker that provides a common platform for applications to send and receive messages, and for message queues to be stored. Can be used for inter-process communication.
            Significance: Exposed RabbitMQ Management Consoles can allow attackers to monitor and control the message queues, create new exchanges, and send messages, potentially disrupting the communication or stealing sensitive data. The messages may be logged or stored.
            Controversy: Data and messages can be lost if the queues are exposed. It is important to protect the integrity of queue data. The consoles often allow for administrative level tasks.
